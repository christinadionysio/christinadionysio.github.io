I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin). 
There, I am a member of the [DAMS Lab](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dams) headed by [Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io).
My research interests lie in multimodal machine learning, focusing on multimodal alignment. 

Before that, I completed my bachelor's in Software Engineering and Management and my master's in Computer Science at the [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home). 
My bachelor thesis focused on integrating a centerline algorithm into an Open Science Platform for Medical Image Processing called [Studierfenster](http://studierfenster.icg.tugraz.at) at the 
[Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home). 
I wrote my master's thesis on the topic "Spatial-Temporal Alignment of Multimodal Datasets", supervised by Matthias Boehm. 

Next to my undergraduate studies, I worked as a part-time software engineer at [Up2Go Austria GmbH](https://www.up2go.com).
